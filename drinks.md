## Ya Mocha My Weekend: Stimulating Mocha Liqueur

## Acknowledgements

Many thanks to my sister Talitha and my wife AmberDawn for their many contributions to liqueur names and label designs. Without these epic badasses, I'm sure that my pumpkin spice liqueur would have a much lamer name, and I know that the labels would have been woefully inadequate (Thanks again, Talitha!).
