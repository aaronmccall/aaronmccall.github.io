## Backin' Black: Bespoke blackberry liqueur

- **Taking the black water**

  - 1.5oz Backin’ Black
  - 1.5oz Aviation gin
  - 0.5oz Dolin dry vermouth 
  - 0.5oz lime juice
  - 0.5oz gum syrup
  - 2 dashes angostura orange bitters
  - 1ml activated charcoal suspension
  - 5 drops bay extract
  - 2 drops 20% saline
  - 2oz lime seltzer (or club soda)
  
  Shake all but seltzer with plenty of ice until well chilled and aerated. Strain into a rocks glass with 1” crushed ice and top with seltzer. Garnish with a little lime zest wildfire, and enjoy with your favorite GoT episode!

- **Midnight Mule**
  
  - 1.5oz vodka (I recommend Solar Spirits Eclipse or Tito's if you can't find it)
  - 1oz Backin' Black
  - 0.5oz fresh-squeezed lime juice
  - 4-6oz ginger beer (Fever Tree or Reed's Strongest are my faves)
  - ice cubes
  
  Add 3-4 ice cubes to your favorite copper mug. Pour lime juice, Backin' Black, and vodka over the ice. Stir to chill. Add the ginger beer and gently stir just enough to combine. Enjoy!
  
## Basic B\*tch: Handcrafted Pumpkin Spice Liqueur

- **It's my toddy (and I'll chai if I want to)**
  - 1oz your favorite brandy (I'm partial to Solar Spirits Grappa and St. Remy V.S.O.P.) or whiskey
  - 1oz Basic B\*tch 
  - 0.5oz fresh-squeezed lemon juice
  - 1 rounded tsp your favorite chai (or 1 tea bag)
  - 6oz near boiling (200º) water
  - sweetener to taste (honey is traditional, but your favorite is just fine)
  
  Make a cup of your favorite chai. After removing the tea infuser (or bag), add the lemon juice, brandy/whiskey, and Basic B\*tch. Now, curl up under your giant yarn afghan with your favorite romance novel (or action movie) and revel in the basicness.
  
- **You're squashin' my noggin**
  - 4oz your favorite nog (I like Darigold and Silk)
  - 4oz your favorite milk (I prefer the richer options)
  - 1.5oz Basic B\*tch
  
  Combine nog and milk and heat to 160º. Add liqueur and stir to combine. Enjoy!

## Clockwork Raspberry: Ultra-delicious Raspberry Liqueur

- **The Lady Bides her Thyme**
  - 1oz limoncello

  - 0.5oz Clockwork Raspberry

- **Ricky Don't Lose My Tonic**
  - 2oz gin (a citrus-forward gin is excellent, as is a London dry)
  - 1oz Clockwork Raspberry
  - 0.5oz lime juice
  - 1 dash orange bitters
  - 1 drop 20% saline
  - 6oz lime seltzer
  - 3.4oz (half bottle) Fever-Tree tonic
  
  Shake all but seltzer and tonic with ice and strain into a large tumbler 2/3 full of ice. Add seltzer and tonic. Variation: replace the lime seltzer and tonic with grapefruit seltzer. Makes a great summer sipper by the pool!

Many thanks to my sister Talitha and my wife AmberDawn for their many contributions to liqueur names and label designs. Without these epic badasses, I'm sure that my pumpkin spice liqueur would have a much lamer name, and I know that the labels would have been woefully inadequate (Thanks again, Talitha!).
